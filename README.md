# Python_BI_2022

In this work, programs were implemented that simulate the UNIX utilities. 

1. __wc__: reads either standard input or a list of computer files and generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count (`-l`), word count (`-w`), and byte count (`-c`).
2. __ls__: lists computer files and directories. With `-a` hidden files are shown
3. __sort__: prints the lines of its input in sorted order
4. __rm__: removes objects such as computer files or directories (with `-r`)
5. __cat__: reads file, writing it to standard output

# Download programs

# How to use programs
1. `./wc.py [-l] [-c] [-w] <filename>`
2. `./ls [-a] <path>`
3. `./sort <filename>`
4. `./rm [-r] <path>`
5. `./cat <filename>`
