The numpy_challenge.py file contains the following functions:

- __matrix_multiplication__ takes two matrices and multiplies them according to the matrix multiplication rule

- __multiplication_check__ takes a list of matrices and returns True if they can be multiplied with each other in the order they are in the list, and False if they can't be multiplied

- __multiply_matrices__ takes a list with matrices, and returns the result of the multiplication if it can be obtained, or returns None if they cannot be multiplied

- __compute_2d_distance__ takes two one-dimensional arrays with a pair of values and calculates the distance between them

- __compute_multidimensional_distance__ takes two one-dimensional arrays with any number of values and calculates the distance between them

- __compute_pair_distances__ takes a two-dimensional array, where each row is an observation and each column is a feature, and calculates the matrix of pairwise distances
